## Memory Card Game
## Background
The project involves developing a retro game designed to evoke nostalgia in the user. The game is a matching card game that challenges the user's memory and concentration. This "Matching Card Game" is a single-player game. The rules are very simple, yet the game remains challenging. When the game starts, you will see 12 cards with their backs facing the player. Out of these 12 cards, there are 6 pairs. When you click on a card, it will turn over to reveal its face. After turning over the first card, you need to guess which of the remaining 11 cards matches the card you just flipped. If you guess incorrectly, the cards will turn back over. If you guess correctly, the cards will remain face up and will be considered completed. Each guess on the second card will be counted as an attempt, and the game will display the number of attempts you have made. The goal is to match all the pairs with as few attempts as possible.
